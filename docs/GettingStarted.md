# Getting Started

This section of the docs will help you getting QueR installed and setup as well as understanding how to use the package.

## What is batching?

Batching is instead of doing something multiple times individually, you combine that thing and handle it all at once. This can be effective with calling remote events for example. You would want to call it once than 100 times.

## Why QueR

Next you may ask, Why should I use QueR over something like task-queue? QueR is designed to have much more customisation compared to task-queue. Things like specifing flush intervals is just not a thing in task-queue.
